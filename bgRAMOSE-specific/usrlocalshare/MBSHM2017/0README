Welcome!

Presumably, you are reading this file because you read the article
"Changes in gene methylation and expression networks accompany caste
specialization and ageing in a social insect" genomics". by
Claire Morandin, Volker P. Brendel, Liselotte Sundström, Heikki Helanterä &
Alexander S. Mikheyev; submitted 2017. 

Well, you are in the right spot.  You can reproduce bit-by-bit what we reported
in that article by following the instructions below.  Thanks to Jetstream, you
are on your VM with everything you need preloaded!  See the documentation in
/usr/local/src.  You can follow our example on this VM; you can use this VM
image to run the pre-installed code on your own data; or you can look at the
setup instructions in /usr/local/src and learn from our experience how to set up
the requisite programs on your own server.

Can you ask for more?

Ok, to reproduce the example we discussed in the paper, do the following:

1) Make sure that your VM instance is at least m1.xlarge (24 CPU, 60GB RAM,
   60GB disk).

2) Attach a volume of at least 600GB to your VM instance.

2) We assume the the volume is mounted as /vol_b.

3) As sudo, create a directory DATA on /vol_b and give ownership to yourself.
   This is what we like to do, but if you know what you are doing, you can set
   up things differently of course (replace "<user>" by your user name):

   cd /vol_b
   sudo mkdir DATA
   sudo chown <user>:<user> DATA

4) cd /vol_b/DATA
   cp -ra /usr/local/share/bgRAMOSE/MBSHM17 ./

5) Follow the instructions in MCALLS/Fe/0README and RWORK/0README


Enjoy!

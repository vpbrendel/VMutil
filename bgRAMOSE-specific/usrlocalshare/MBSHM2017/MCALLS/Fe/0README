The Emerging & Old directories contain the BWASP makefiles that produced the deposited
*.mcalls.zip methylation calls discussed in the paper.  You can run the xrunzip
script in the project ../ parent directory to unzip all these files and proceed
with the BWASPR analysis in directory ../../RWORK.

If you wish to reproduce the entire BWASP analysis, you first need to retrieve the
original genome and read data (for now, go to the ../../ parent directory and run
the ./xsetup script after you downloaded the FeDATA directory from IU Box to your
home directory on this VM.)
Then, in this directory, running the script
	time ./xdoit >& err
should reproduce all the BWASP workflows used to generate the *.mcalls methylation
calls. (There will be trivial differences in some counts relative to the deposited
*.mcalls.zip files because of minor updates in bismark since our original work.)
In our test, this took just short of 14h and used 553 Gb of disk space.

You should probably start with running just parts of the analysis.  For convenience,
	./xdoitEQ >& err
will just analyze the EmergingQueen data (and generate about 140 GB of output in about
four hours).

You can run the script
	./xsavespace
to remove temporary output files and zip up others to reduce space used.  You can
run the space saving make commands after each replicate analysis or after the
aggregate sample analyses, as your available disk space demands.  For the EmergingQueen
data, the 145 GB EmergingQueen output directory gets reduced to 31 GB.

You should always check the error files in the subdirectories for any problems with
executing the workflow.  If the folllowing command gives 24 *mstats files with 44 lines
each, probably everything was ok:
	wc -l */*/*mstats */*/rep*/*mstats
Also
	./xcheck
could be run to invoke the make commands again - the output files */*/errcheck and
*/*/rep*/errcheckshould say that there is nothing to be done (otherwise, the
command will do it!).

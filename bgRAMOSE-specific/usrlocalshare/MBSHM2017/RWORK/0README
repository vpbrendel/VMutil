The BWASPR analyses use the BWASP workflow generated *.mcalls methylation call
files in the ../MCALLS/Fe/Old and New subdirectories.  To work with the files we
used in the paper, run the xrunzip script in the ../MCALLS/Fe directory to
unzip all these files.

If you wish to reproduce the *.mcalls files, please follow the instructions in
../MCALLS/0README.

If you wish to reproduce the entire BWASPR analysis, you first need to retrieve
the original genome data (for now using the ../xsetup script after you
downloaded the FeDATA directory from IU Box to your home directory on this VM.)

To run the BWASPR analysis with our chosen paramenters, execute
	./xdoit Fe_4s OUT-Fe_4s >& err
The output directory and its subdirectories will contain 0README files that
review what has been generated.

If you want to make changes, you can edit the Fe_4s.conf file and run
	./xcheck Fe_4s
which will produce new output in directory NEW-Fe_4s and compare with the
output in OUT-Fe_4s.

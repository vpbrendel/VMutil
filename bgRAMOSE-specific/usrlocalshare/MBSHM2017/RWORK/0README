The BWASPR analyses use the BWASP workflow generated *.mcalls methylation call
files in the ../MCALLS/Fe/Emerging and Old subdirectories.  To work with the
files we used in the paper, first run the xunzip script in the ../MCALLS
directory to unzip all these files.

If you wish to reproduce the *.mcalls files, please follow the instructions in
../MCALLS/0README.

If you wish to reproduce the entire BWASPR analysis, you first need to retrieve
the original genome data. For now use the ../xsetup script after you
downloaded the FeDATA directory from IU Box to your home directory on this VM:
	(cd ../; head -4 ./xsetup | bash; cd RWORK)
You will also need to parse the annotation like this:
	(cd ../MCALLS/Fe/genome; make -f Makefile_parse_GFF3_Fe >& err; cd ../../../RWORK)

To run the BWASPR analysis with our chosen paramenters, execute
	./xdoit Fe_4s OUT-Fe_4s >& err
The output directory and its subdirectories will contain 0README files that
review what has been generated.

If you want to make changes, you can edit the Fe_4s.conf file and run
	./xcheck Fe_4s
which will produce new output in directory NEW-Fe_4s and compare with the
output in OUT-Fe_4s.

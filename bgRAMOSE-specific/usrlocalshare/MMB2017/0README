Welcome!

Presumably, you are reading this file because you read the article
"Using RAMPAGE to identify and annotate promoters in insect genomes" by
R. Taylor Raborn and Volker P. Brendel; Methods in Molecular Biology,
in the press 2017.

Well, you are in the right spot.  You can reproduce bit-by-bit what we reported
in that article by following the instructions below.  Thanks to Jetstream, you
are on your VM with everything you need preloaded!  See the documentation in
/usr/local/src.  You can follow our example on this VM; you can use this VM
image to run the pre-installed code on your own data; or you can look at the
setup instructions in /usr/local/src and learn from our experience how to set up
the requisite programs on your own server.

Can you ask for more?

Ok, to reproduce the example we discussed in the paper, do the following:

1) Attach a volume of at least 100GB to your VM instance.

2) We assume the the volume is mounted as /vol_b.

3) As sudo, create a directory DATA on /vol_b and give ownership to yourself.
   This is what we like to do, but if you know what you are doing, you can set
   up things differently of course (replace "<user>" by your user name):

   cd /vol_b
   sudo mkdir DATA
   sudo chown <user>:<user> DATA

4) cd /vol_b/DATA
   mkdir MMB
   cd MMB
   cp /usr/local/share/bgRAMOSE/MMB/xrunMMB ./

5) time ./xrunMMB

Now go off and run a marathon, enjoy a faculty meeting, or re-acquaint yourself
with your spouse over lunch.

Depending on download speeds, the entire workflow should finish in under 3h.
~/ncbi will contain the data downloaded from NCBI, everything else should be in
/vol_b/DATA/MMB.

Enjoy!

Welcome!

Presumably, you are reading this file because you read the article
"Rice cultivar-specific gene expression studies through integrated experimental
and computational genomics". by R. Taylor Raborn, ..., Bing Yang, and
Volker P. Brendel; submitted 2017. 

Well, you are in the right spot.  You can reproduce bit-by-bit what we reported
in that article by following the instructions below.  Thanks to Jetstream, you
are on your VM with everything you need preloaded!  See the documentation in
/usr/local/src.  You can follow our example on this VM; you can use this VM
image to run the pre-installed code on your own data; or you can look at the
setup instructions in /usr/local/src and learn from our experience how to set up
the requisite programs on your own server.

Can you ask for more?

Ok, to reproduce the example we discussed in the paper, do the following:

1) Make sure that your VM instance is at least s1.xlarge (24 CPU, 60GB RAM,
   240GB disk).

2) Attach a volume of at least 400GB to your VM instance.

2) We assume the the volume is mounted as /vol_b.

3) As sudo, create a directory DATA on /vol_b and give ownership to yourself.
   This is what we like to do, but if you know what you are doing, you can set
   up things differently of course (replace "<user>" by your user name):

   cd /vol_b
   sudo mkdir DATA
   sudo chown <user>:<user> DATA

4) cd /vol_b/DATA
   mkdir RCG
   cd RCG
   cp /usr/local/share/bgRAMOSE/RCG/xrunRCG ./

5) time ./xrunRCG

Now go off and run a couple of marathons, enjoy a faculty meeting, or re-acquaint yourself
with your spouse over a short vacation.

Seriously:  This is really a lot of data work and will take a few days to run. More advisable
might be to look at what the script invokes (lots of other scripts, in subdirectories) and
just reproduce particular steps as needed.

Enjoy!
